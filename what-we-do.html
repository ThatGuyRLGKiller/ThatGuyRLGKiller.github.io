            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <p>
                Red Light Gaming is a community for people who prefer to chill and play instead of sweating their asses off trying to win.  
                If you're someone who enjoys a competitive gaming environment, you're welcome here!  
                However, we do have one rule: <strong>don't be a dick</strong>. Treat everyone with respect and enjoy the vibe.
