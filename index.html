            <h2>About ThatGuyRLGKiller / RLGKiller</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 19-year-old and have been playing games most of my life. I'm a big fan of ARPG, RPG, and some FPS games. 
                I started playing on the PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360. Later in life, we ended up getting a PS4, and eventually, I got an Xbox One.
            </p>
            <p>My PC Specs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prebuilt: Skytech Blaze 3.0</li>
                <li>CPU: 11th Gen i7</li>
                <li>GPU: RTX 3060 Ti</li>
                <li>RAM: 16GB DDR4</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I use a Logitech G502 Hero for my mouse and a cheap ONN keyboard I got from Walmart.

            <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I haven’t played on a PC my whole life, but it’s my favorite thing I own. I’ve been running a Discord server on it ever since I got it. 
                I used to be a streamer, but I can no longer stream since we moved out to the country and my WiFi has a 600+ ping. 
                Now, I make YouTube videos, but I need to get used to doing it again.
